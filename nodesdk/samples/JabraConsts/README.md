# Sample program: JabraConsts

## Installation instructions

1. The sample program is referencing Jabra NodeSDK directly from the parent folder, so it is required to build this package first:
   - On a command line, switch to the parent nodesdk folder and run `npm install`. This will build Jabra NodeSDK and install all of its dependencies.
   - Now change back to the `nodesdk/samples/JabraConsts` directory and build/install this sample program using `npm install`.

## Running the program

1. Start sample program with `npm start`
